### What is it?
A simple IRC client written in <a href="http://ahkscript.org/">AutoHotkey</a> focused on connecting to a single channel. 

Chat with your community without walking every user through setting up and learning mIRC.

LoneIRC has one settings file that you point to your chatroom; zip that up with the compiled exe and send it off. Done.
