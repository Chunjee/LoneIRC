{"name":"LoneIRC","tagline":"Single Destination IRC","body":"### What is it?\r\nA simple IRC client written in <a href=\"http://ahkscript.org/\">AutoHotkey</a> focused on connecting to a single channel. \r\n\r\nChat with your community without walking every user through setting up and learning mIRC.\r\nLoneIRC has one settings file that you point to your chatroom; zip that up with the compiled exe and send it off. Done.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n+ Optional Text to Speech\r\n+ Optional TimeStamps\r\n+ Optional Chatlogs\r\n+ Optional Sounds via [LHCP-X](https://github.com/Chunjee/LHCP-X)\r\n\r\n#### What is LHCP-X?\r\nLeroyHillsCatPower; It allows you to type in slash commands and play a sound clip for you and anyone else who has the mod.\r\nSounds pretty dumb right? Well it is. Be stupid with us.\r\n\r\n### Contributors and Libraries\r\n* (@G33kDude) - [MyRC irc bot framework](https://github.com/G33kDude/MyRC)\r\n* (@Jim-VxE) - [JSON parser](https://github.com/Jim-VxE/AHK-Lib-JSON_ToObj)\r\n* (Bentschi) - [ahk socket library](http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/94376-socket-class-%C3%BCberarbeitet)\r\n* (@AHK-just-me) - [Class_RichEdit](https://github.com/AHK-just-me/Class_RichEdit)\r\n* (Learning one) - [Text to speech functions](http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/53429-function-easy-text-to-speech/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support / Contact\r\nThis software is made available by the value for value model; If you got value from this software, you are kindly requested to send value back in some form.\r\n\r\nPlease give me credit for my work.
